## PHP project 

### Stack
- PHP  

Since I didn't find any technology in the current project stack that would benefit this project, I decided to go with a simple XAMPP setup.

### Setup

To setup databases:
- Configure server details in **db_connection.php**
- Generate Database structure with **db.php**
- Run migration in **db/sectors.php** for sector related data
