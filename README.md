## PHP project 

### Database dump
Location: db/db_dump  

### Stack
- PHP  

Since I didn't find any technology in the companies current project stack that would benefit this project, I decided to go with a simple XAMPP setup.

### Setup

To setup databases:
- Configure server details in **db_connection.php**
- Generate Database structure with **db/db_create.php** script
- Run migration script in **db/migrations/insert_sectors.php** for sector related data
